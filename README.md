My workshop under-workbench heater has been playing up for some time, so it was time to get it fixed - or throw it away, far too easy an option in our throwaway society!

I'm all for the Right To Repair so I dove right in and ripped out its innards (some kind of microcontroller circuit board) and replaced it with an Arduino Nano 168. There! Just like that!

Ok, there were a few things to consider along the way, and I was designing the hardware by the seat of my pants, seeing what might work and what didn't.

I had to work with the existing heating element, air fan and thermistor, but I replaced the mains relays and adjusted the actual logic of the ÂµContoller to my liking! 

I even used the "dodgy" Tenstar Robot 5v PSU from video #105 in which we sort of branded it as a bit UNSAFE! Well, this was the perfect opportunity to use it in a Real World situation.

The end result was better than I expected - it works better now than it did when brand new! Yes, really. And I can always "tweak" the logic if I want as I ensured that I had access to the Nano's USB port.

Just goes to show that if you put your mind to it there's nothing that can stop you - not even (potentially) lethal, high current mains voltage!

The "final" (at time of writing) sketch can be found on my Github https://www.github.com/ralphbacon along with this description and anything else I find that is pertinent.
